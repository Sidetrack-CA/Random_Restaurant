## Hungry and indecisive
#### Also know as random restaurant

This web app randomly picks a restaurant, given two selected cuisines. It stores previously visited restaurants in firebase so that it won't be picked again. Once a restaurant has been chosen, there are options to allow it to be picked again or be blacklisted
